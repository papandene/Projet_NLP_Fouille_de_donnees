 # Classification of documents by opinion
 

 # The goal of this project is to implement and evaluate methods for the classification of
 documents by opinion.

 # The corpus
 A set of textual data is made available to you on Moodle. It is a corpus of 10,000 documents containing reviews of films by Internet users. To each document is associated its polarity according to the review (+1: positive, -1: negative). The file of the documents is formatted in a cvs table (one review per line), another csv file contains the polarity of the reviews per document (- 1/+1). A direct correspondence exists between the line numbers of the documents and the polarities.

 # Step 1: Data transformation and vectorization

 # Step 2: Pre-processing of documents

 # Step 3: Implementation of classification algorithms :

 - KNN,

 - Decision trees,

 - Na√Øve Bayes,

 - Vector support machines 

 - The rules of association

 - Classify set

 # Step 4: Analysis
